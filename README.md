Check our [Project Proposal](https://github.com/mjm973/Illuminated/blob/master/project_proposal.md)

Check our [Technical specifications](https://github.com/mjm973/Illuminated/blob/master/technical_specifications.md)

## IMPORTANT NOTE

- Photon Unity Networking/Resources/PhotonServerSettings

- Enable Auto-Join Lobby

- Otherwise, enjoy crying while wondering why things are failing

## IMPORTANT NOTE #2

Please create folder `Assets/Ignore` and place packages (Photon, SteamVR, and other unused assets) inside folder for easy Git ignoring. Thanks.

## USER TESTING FEEDBACK APR 19:

- More Intricate Level design: there is little incentive to move around right now
- Bigger teleport radius
- Grenade lighting radius increase overtime (so I don't reveal myself everytime I shoot)
- Feedback for hitting or getting hit (particle effect on the grenade to denote radius of damage)
- Better way to denote health (player doesn't seem to be checking bracelet, so try a screen UI or breathing sound, etc)
- Use the grip for another type of weapon (raycast, etc)

## TODO:

- Game Logic:
  - Determine how to start game: does a player controls when to start or a master controls it, or something eles

- Effects:
  - Add visual/ audio/ haptic feedbacks to shooting and get shot by grenade
  - UI for player health values (Green to Red for life or almost death) and how many grenades we have
  
- Extra:
  - Avatar modeling


## DONE:
