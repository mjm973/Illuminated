## USER TESTING FEEDBACK MAY 3 AND CONSEQUENT PROGRESS:
UI:
[x]- Add UI at start and end of game
[x]- Position the UI better
KINDA- UI for being illuminated by lights

Sound:
[x]- Add damage/ hurt sound
[x]- Add breathing sound when a player is dying

Environment:
[x]- Scale down the environment
[x]- Dial down the lights
[x]- Have more posters and graffiti -OHHHH YEAHHHH

Controller:
[x]- Teleport with left hand
[x]- Have bracelets on both hands

Game Logic:
[x]- Rebalance damage
[x]- Smaller grenade illumination radius
- Potentially cut down teleport cool down - SO INSTEAD WE GAVE EACH HAND ITS OWN COOLDOWN 


## USER TESTING FEEDBACK APR 19:

- Player not doing what to do
- More Intricate Level design: there is little incentive to move around right now
- Bigger teleport radius
- Grenade lighting radius increase overtime (so I don't reveal myself everytime I shoot)
- Feedback for hitting or getting hit (particle effect on the grenade to denote radius of damage)
- Better way to denote health (player doesn't seem to be checking bracelet, so try a screen UI or breathing sound, etc)
- Use the grip for another type of weapon (raycast, etc) 

## TODO:

- Game Logic:
  - Determine how to start game: does a player controls when to start or a master controls it, or something eles

- Effects:
  - Add visual/ audio/ haptic feedbacks to shooting and get shot by grenade
  - UI for player health values (Green to Red for life or almost death) and how many grenades we have
  
- Extra:
  - Avatar modeling


## DONE:
