## GENERAL OVERVIEW

### Okay, so: what __is__ *Illuminated*?

*Illuminated* is an adventurous and thrilling first person shooter experience. It inverts your expectations on usual shooter games: instead of seeing and shooting the opponents, you have to illuminate the environment to uncover the position of the other players before taking the killing shot.

Playing with the concept of lighting and visibility, *Illuminated* merges intense action and stealth game play in a novel way. The environment itself is visible but you cannot fully see it. While another person might be present, you cannot see him or her without casting a light either. *Illuminated* allows you to see part of the environment layout but that’s not the whole picture - pun intended.


###  Why do you use Virtual Reality as the medium?

This project is uniquely suited to VR, as a player’s concept of spatiality is different on a 2D screen than viewing it in real surroundings. VR enables a more intuitive and kinesthetic mode of exploration. Creating a procedural experience, we plan to modify the fundamental ways physics and reality work and we need the immersion of VR to make the experience believable yet refreshing to the player.

Social experience is at the core of *Illuminated* for a few reasons. First, it is meant to be a competitive experience, so having at least two people engaging in the space is crucial. The main interactions arise between players in conflict, rather than between a player and their environment. Second, while one can explore the environment by oneself, the act of revealing and finding a second player is also central to the game, as it becomes a chase between actors with incomplete information. The tension builds slowly, spiking when another player is finally revealed, before they dart back into the invisible, and the search is on once more.

### What kind of experience or emotion do I get playing *Illuminated*?

By flipping one of physical reality’s core rules around, we are forcing the player(s) into an experience where they must re-learn how to interact with the world under the tension of being constantly hunted. We aim to encourage competitive play where the winner is the last player standing. In order to encourage active play, we will penalize players who spend too long wondering in one place or not initializing any illumination.

Our space is designed to reflect a relatable environment. It withholds its characters unless lit up by the characters. We want to ease the players into familiarity with *Illuminated* rules slowly: the more they explore what seems to be an abstract world, the more they understand the world better and come out on top.


### What is somethig unique or unusual about *Illuminated*?

The core concept of the experience is that we hide players’ existences at first but they will have to reveal themselves when exploring the environment or finding others. In this way, the weapon also becomes a weakness: shooting or lighting up others exposes players themselves too.

The concept of exposing both yourself and your opponents provides a blend of action and stealth gameplay. Often, action and stealth mechanics in games do not cooperate, but coexist. Sneak around unless you’re spotted and then gun down your enemies. Or defeat everyone in sight so that you may slip back into the shadows. One mechanic is employed until it outlives its usefulness, then gives way to the other. *Illuminated* challenges this relationship by combining its action and stealth elements into a single mechanic. Attacking and hiding are intertwined within the act of shooting: the attack *is* the stealth.
